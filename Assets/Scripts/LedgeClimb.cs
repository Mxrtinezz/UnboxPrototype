/* 
 Look into different STATES, if the raycast detects a ledge wall, change "transform.forward (z axis)" to "transform.up (y axis)"
 make a thing that allows a button press to activate the "ledge wall mode", basically switching the player to moving across the Y axis

Make 2 Ground related raycasts - one that goes diagonally forward and detects the Ground layer, allowing the player to move forward
and another that detects the Ground layer directly below and turns gravity back on again.

Use the Ground Check in the FPSMovement script for this too.

USE RIGIDBODY STUFF!! - Probably make it "Is Kinematic" so it's controlled by script stuff.



Notes for raycasting!

- ONLY DO RAYCASTING STUFF AFTER TESTING WITH BUTTONS!!

Things to research:
- How to freeze gravity
- How to switch axis movement
- Rigidbodies and how to use them (apparently they dont work well with character controllers)
- Game states
